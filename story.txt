I have a cat. We met each other when I was twelve years old, and now I'm twenty. For the past eight years, we always ate together, slept together, and played games together. But yesterday, he suddenly disappeared.

After checking the police station and hospitals, we found him in the back of the village primary school, very, very dirty and very, very hungry.

As soon as I got home, I fed my cat a bowl of fish and chicken and gave him a big bath. Then, I played with him for a while with a ball of yarn and as we both started getting tired we went to bed. I woke up the next morning with him in my arms and I felt very happy.
