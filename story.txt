I have a cat. We met each other when I was twelve years old, and now I'm twenty. For the past eight years, we always ate together, slept together, and played games together. But yesterday, he suddenly disappeared.

After checking the police station and hospitals, we found him in the back of the village primary school, very, very dirty and very, very hungry.
